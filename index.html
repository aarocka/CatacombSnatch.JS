<h3>About</h3>

<p>Once upon a time, Mojang teamed up with Humble Bundle to do a charity event called the Humble Mojam Bundle. The challenge was to build a game in a weekend. Anyone who contributed money gained access to the source code while the games were being build. Wolfire Games(The company who started the Humble Bundles) and Oxeye Games(Jeb/Cobalt) also pitched in. Fast forward to , I got really bored in Social Studies class, so I decided to port Mojang's Catacomb Snatch to JavaScript. CatacombSnatch.JS was built using the Impact.JS game engine.</p>

<h3>Understanding the Source Code</h3>

<p>Due to the fact that Impact is not free, and the fact that I am not sure if he would like me sharing the source code for Impact, I left the engine source out of the repo. However I did include the original source code for Catacomb Snatch(I think Notch is cool with that). If you own a copy of Impact, simply download a copy and drag the <code>lib/impact</code> folder into the <code>catacombsnatch/impact/lib</code> folder. If you don't own a copy,  I have a minified/compiled version of the javascript. Just run it from a webserver.</p>

<h3>Directory Structure</h3>

<p>The impact folder contains the game. Inside that folder contains the media folder and the lib folder. The lib folder contains the weltmiester level editor and the game sourcecode. However it is missing the impact folder which contains the engine its self.</p>

<p>The Ejecta folder contains the iOS port of the game. </p>

<p>The CatacombScatch_SRC folder is the original Java sourcecode.</p>
