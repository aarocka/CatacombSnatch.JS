#ABOUT
So this is my attempt at porting Mojang's Catacomb Snatch. Catacomb Snatch was a
game created by Mojang for a charity event called the Humble Mojam Bundle and
released the sourcecode for the game. My port is build in Impact. This is more of
a ground up rewrite than a port and this version will be a little different. I am
releasing only part of the source code because Impact costs money and releasing
the full sourcecode would basically allow you to gain Impact for free. I am
releasing a baked version of the game along with the full sourcecode for the page,
all of the entiteis, server side code, and art assets.

#License Summaries
Ok while the entities and code I make is opensource, the game engine is not. This is why I'm not releasing the engine source, only the entities and art assets. The game is tecnically owned my Mojang AB, and the music is owned by c418. So yea, use common sense and don't be stupid. If you make derivitives of this game, please give credit where credit is due. Even if you don't think you need to credit them, credit them anyway just to be safe. Also here is the original Impact License, for who knows what. I cant find a license agreement for the original Catacomb Snatch, otherwise I would include that too.
